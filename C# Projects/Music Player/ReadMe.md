This is a music player project. Goals of this project is to create a console application that is capable of playing .mp3 and .wav audio files.
In the future, maybe create a separate feature that displays wave forms as the audio plays.

Initial idea is based upon this youtube video:

Future notes:
* Add a feature to view waveforms as audio plays
* Make this an injectable widget for future projects
* Currently, needs to have the full filepath in order to properly play a song. Will need to investigate for playing filepaths relative to the application
* Add methods to play songs from a direct audio file instead of simply providing a filepath.
