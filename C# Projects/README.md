This folder contains personal projects mainly using the C# language. The goal of these projects is to become a better developer who is more experienced in C# and .Net framework. 

Currently not sure what kind of project I want to start with, but I'm currently thinking about some sort of Database application for some of the mobile gacha games I'm playing (FGO and Arknights).
Another idea is a possible extension of the Pokedex application from HCL class. Projects like these, where the size and complexity are more than simple, will probably be stored in a separate repository.

This folder is intended to store simple projects such as MP3/WAV player, tictactoe, etc.
